# SETUP
# 
# To generate documentation install the "Nasdanika Ecore Documentation Generator v1.0.0" from the Eclipse Marketplace (Help->Eclipse marketplace)
# For the generation of the class diagrams figures, PlantUML is used, which uses GraphWiz 2.38 internally. Install this from https://www.graphviz.org/ . Install it in its default directory for the plugin to let it find the dot.exe executable.
# Configure your system's Environment variables to let the plugin generate larger images by setting PLANTUML_LIMIT_SIZE to e.g. 20000. (current image is about 10.000 pixels wide)
#
# 
# USING
# Right click this file and select "Generate Ecore Documentation" to start generating documentation.
# The files are stored in gen/site
#
# In the gen/ folder a file called index_with_intro.html is stored, which contains a nicer intro than the default empty one. Copy this one over the index.html.
# You have to do this every time because the plugin empties the folder before generating.
#
#
# Model file to generate documentation from:
models:
  - model/esdl.ecore

# Output location for the HTML site (eclipse help is also possible)
output:
  site: /esdl/gen/site   

# Link the Ecore metamodel to the javadoc of EMF, otherwise it also generates files for that model
modeldocs:
  site:
    http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore: https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/emf/javadoc/2.11/ 

# This only seems to work for Eclipse help documentation and can probably be removed for the HTML site:
