# ESDL model reference documentation
This repo contains the files for the ESDL model reference website at https://energytransition.github.io/
These files are generated from the ```esdl.ecore``` model using the 'Nasdanika Ecore Documentation Generator' v1.0.0. 
See the configuration file ```ecore-docgen.yml``` in the ESDL repo for more information on how to setup the documentation generation.

The output of the generation will be in ```esdl/documentation/energytransition.github.io/```. The last folder is a git submodule for the http://github.com/energytransition/energytransition.github.io repo. This repo is automatically published to GitHub pages.
